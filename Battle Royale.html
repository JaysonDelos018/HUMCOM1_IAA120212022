            Battle royale video games are multiplayer games that involve a large number of gamers, typically around 100, controlling characters who parachute onto a virtual map, where they will battle until there is only one person left standing. 
            Battle royale games, such as free-to-play games Fortnite, PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), and Apex Legends, among others, have risen to widespread popularity over the last few years. 
            These games come in multiple modes, enabling gamers to play solo or squad up in groups of two, three, or four to be the last team alive.
        </p>
        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">
            A battle royale game also combines elements of scavenging alongside its survival aesthetic, with the player base starting with minimal equipment, collecting loot, and then trying to eliminate all of the other players while staying inside of an ever-shrinking “safe zone.”
            As the genre has grown in popularity, games have implemented their own special twists, like the ability to revive teammates, the opportunity to fight for the chance to respawn, or special character abilities.

        <h1>Examples of Battle Royale Games</h1>
        <h2>Apex Legends</h2>
        <img src="images/Apex.jpg " width="400px">
        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">
            Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. 
            It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022. 
            A mobile version of the game specially designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile has also been announced which is scheduled to release in May 2022 on Android and iOS. The game supports cross-platform play.

        <h2>Fortnite</h2>
        <img src="images/Fortnite.jpg " width="400px">
        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">
            Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. 
            It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where strategic thinking is a must in order to survive. 
            There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite.
