            Esports (or electronic sports) is a term used to describe competitive video gaming.
            It’s different from standard video gaming in that esports is competitive (human-vs-human) and usually has an engaging spectator element to it, like traditional sports.
        </p>

        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">
            Esports tournaments usually consist of amateur or professional gamers competing against one another for a cash prize.
            For example, League of Legends pits five players against another five in a virtual battle arena to destroy each other’s base. 
            Whereas in shooters, like Call of Duty, Overwatch and Counter-Strike, players are pit against each other in various modes to complete an objective.
        </p>

        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">
            Think of esports as competitive video gaming where skill and professionalism is celebrated. 
            The pro gamers who play at this level know the games inside out, much like a professional footballer or athlete would in their respective fields.
            Players can either play one-on-one against one another (in games like FIFA and Street Fighter), or in teams. 
            For example, in Halo, two teams of four play off against each other, while in Overwatch, two teams of six compete.
            Rules and strategies can differ greatly depending on the game in question.
        </p>

        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">
            Some of the most popular esports games include League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, Dota 2 and Call of Duty, but there are many others.
